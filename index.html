                <p>Hi, my name is Edwin. I am a fullstack developer from Sacramento, CA.</p><br>
                <p>I'm currently enrolled in Thinkful's fullstack flex program. I was drawn to coding because it combines two skills that have always
               interested me and which I find extremely rewarding, problem-solving and creativity. I love learning about new methods and tools to create
               visually stunning and functionally intuitive human interfaces. Once I complete the course I'm looking forward to joining a team that shares my passion.</p><br>
                <p>Outside of coding I'm usually spending time with my daughter and girlfriend, playing strategy games, or working on rewriting my book.</p>
